# SignGenie

I spearheaded the development of this project alongside a diverse team of experts. Together, we crafted a SignGenie project which uses a Machine Learning YoLo model designed for real-time Sign Language detection, with the ability to convert it into text and speech. This was achieved using Python libraries, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. While the project is expected to be hosted on AWS (although not yet live), it held significant promise for the future.
